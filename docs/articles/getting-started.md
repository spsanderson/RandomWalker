## Random Walks

What is a random walk? A random walk is a mathematical concept
describing a path consisting of a succession of random steps. Each step
is independent of the previous ones, and the direction and distance of
each step are determined by chance. The simplest form of a random walk
is a one-dimensional walk, where an object moves either forward or
backward with equal probability at each step.

In a random walk, the average position of the object after $`N`$ steps
is zero, but the average of the square of the distance from the starting
point is $`N`$, meaning the object is typically about $`\sqrt{N}`$ steps
away from the start after $`N`$ steps. This concept is widely used in
various fields, including physics, economics, and computer science, to
model phenomena such as particle diffusion, stock price movements, and
network topology.

Random Walk Example

In finance, the random walk theory suggests that stock prices move
unpredictably, making it impossible to predict future prices based on
past movements. This theory underpins the Efficient Market Hypothesis,
which posits that all available information is already reflected in
stock prices, thus making it impossible to consistently outperform the
market.

Random Walk in Higher Dimensions

In higher dimensions, random walks exhibit complex geometric properties
and can be used to model more intricate systems, such as the behavior of
particles in a fluid or the structure of networks.

By understanding random walks, researchers can gain insights into
various stochastic processes and their applications across different
scientific and practical domains.

Now that we have a basic understanding of these concepts, let’s explore
how we can create and visualize random walks using the `RandomWalker`
package in R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `RandomWalker` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("RandomWalker")
```

You can install the development version of `RandomWalker` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/spsanderson/RandomWalker) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/RandomWalker")
```

## Example Usage

Let’s start by generating a simple random walk using the
[`rw30()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/reference/rw30.md)
function from the `RandomWalker` package. This function generates a
random walk with 30 steps.

``` r
rw30() |>
  head(10)
#> # A tibble: 10 × 3
#>    walk_number step_number     y
#>    <fct>             <int> <dbl>
#>  1 1                     1  0   
#>  2 1                     2 -1.40
#>  3 1                     3 -1.14
#>  4 1                     4 -3.58
#>  5 1                     5 -3.59
#>  6 1                     6 -2.97
#>  7 1                     7 -1.82
#>  8 1                     8 -3.64
#>  9 1                     9 -3.89
#> 10 1                    10 -4.13
```

The output shows the first 10 steps of the random walk. Each step
represents the position of the object after moving forward or backward
by one unit. The
[`rw30()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/reference/rw30.md)
function takes no parameters and generates 30 random walks with 100
steps. It uses the [`rnorm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html)
function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution with mean
0 and standard deviation 1.

## Attributes

Each function in the `RandomWalker` package has attributes that can be
accessed using the
[`attributes()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html) function. For
example, let’s look at the attributes of the
[`rw30()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/reference/rw30.md)
function:

``` r
atb <- attributes(rw30())
atb[!names(atb) %in% c("row.names")]
#> $names
#> [1] "walk_number" "step_number" "y"          
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
#> 
#> $num_walks
#> [1] 30
#> 
#> $num_steps
#> [1] 100
#> 
#> $mu
#> [1] 0
#> 
#> $sd
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $fns
#> [1] "rw30"
#> 
#> $dimension
#> [1] 1
```

## Visualizing Random Walks

To visualize the random walk generated by the
[`rw30()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/reference/rw30.md)
function, we can use the
[`visualize_walks()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/reference/visualize_walks.md)
function. This function creates a line plot showing the path of the
random walk over time.

``` r
visualize_walks(rw30())
```

![Visualize a Random Walk of 30
simulations](getting-started_files/figure-html/random_walk_visual_example-1.png)

The plot shows the path of the random walk over time, with the x-axis
representing the number of steps and the y-axis representing the
position of the object. The random walk exhibits a random pattern of
movement, with the object moving forward and backward in a seemingly
unpredictable manner.

## Future Direction

As of now `RandomWalker` only supports 1-dimensional random walks. In
the future, we plan to extend the package to support higher-dimensional
random walks and provide additional functionalities for analyzing and
visualizing random walks in various contexts.

We hope this vignette has provided you with a basic understanding of
random walks and how to use the `RandomWalker` package in R. If you have
any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
