\details{
Brownian Motion, also known as the Wiener process, is a
continuous-time random process that describes the random movement of particles
suspended in a fluid. It is named after the physicist Robert Brown,
who first described the phenomenon in 1827.

The equation for Brownian Motion can be represented as:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{W(t) = W(0) + sqrt(t) * Z
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Where W(t) is the Brownian motion at time t, W(0) is the initial value of the
Brownian motion, sqrt(t) is the square root of time, and Z is a standard
normal random variable.

Brownian Motion has numerous applications, including modeling stock prices in
financial markets, modeling particle movement in fluids, and modeling random
walk processes in general. It is a useful tool in probability theory and
statistical analysis.
